In case your scanner and parser and semantic analyser do not work properly, you
can use the class files in this subdirectory instead with Assignment 5. The
provided classfiles are Scanner.class, Parser.class, SemanticAnalysis.class and
MiniC.class. You must use *all* classfiles, otherwise the MiniC compiler won't
work.

See the Assignment 5 specification on how to compile with Gradle to use
these provided classfiles.
